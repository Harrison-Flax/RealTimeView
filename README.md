## RealTimeView
Part of my objective to greater learn Java, its utilites, and expand my database knowledge and implementations.
Using Spring Boot here is imperative for linking calls and creating runnable and packaged Java software.

## Overview
Made with JavaFX, SpringBoot, and PostgreSQL.
- ## JavaFX (Frontend): ##
  - UI for dekstop (using Windows for this) but should be comptabile with MacOS and Linux distros
  - Will fetch information and update in real-time with communication from SpringBoot
- ## Spring Boot (Backend): ##
  - Communicates with PostgreSQL, API calls, and creating the local instance
- ## PostgreSQL (Database): ##
  - Relational database with more advanced options for greater storage and retrieval options
  - Will store user preferences including saved indices, historical data, and articles
 
## Future Additions
- Unit testing with JUnit
- Multi-Threaded Methods
- Kubernetes for deployment only (Spring Boot and PostgreSQL Database)
- Postman for debugging and testing APIs
