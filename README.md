## RealTimeView
A desktop application that can fetch stock indices, news articles, and crypto prices in real-time. A personal project.

## Overview
Made with JavaFX, SpringBoot, and MongoDB
- JavaFX (Frontend):
  - UI for dekstop (using Windows for this), but should be comptabile with MacOS and Linux distros
  - Will fetch information and update in real-time with communication from SpringBoot
- SpringBoot (Backend):
  - Communicates with MongoDB (NoSQL database here), API calls, and creating the local instance
- MongoDB (Database):
  - NoSQL database for ease of implementation for a simpler program
  - Will store user preferences including saved indices, historical data, and articles
 
## Future Updates
Might integrate .NET for improved desktop UI and utilize PostgreSQL for more advanced database storage.
