## RealTimeView
A desktop application that can fetch stock indices, news articles, and crypto prices in real-time. A personal project.
Part of my objective to greater learn Java, its utilites, and expand my database knowledge and implementations.

## Overview
Made with JavaFX, SpringBoot, and PostgreSQL.
- ## JavaFX (Frontend): ##
  - UI for dekstop (using Windows for this) but should be comptabile with MacOS and Linux distros
  - Will fetch information and update in real-time with communication from SpringBoot
- ## SpringBoot (Backend): ##
  - Communicates with MongoDB (relational database here), API calls, and creating the local instance
- ## PostgreSQL (Database): ##
  - Relational database with more advanced options for greater storage and retrieval options
  - Will store user preferences including saved indices, historical data, and articles
